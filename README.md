# 2022-DL-Final-Project
 
Code for the DL final project goes here.
Ideally it should mimic the file structure, as described in [page 6 of these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lbggpj_nj4RomOm4q35XUcoOoDsIDvT18GLpOIygC2Q/edit#slide=id.g8646803fdf_0_15).

Also obviously this is a private repo, the submitted files will just the final version of this repo.
